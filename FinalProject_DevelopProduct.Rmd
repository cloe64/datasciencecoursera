## Purpose 
This presentaion is about the final project for the Coursera Data Science Specialization Course: Developing Data Products.

We will use three datasets (cars/pressure/rock) from Rstudio.


## Datasets
In the app, the end users can choose one from three datasets to see the summary.

cars: The speed of cars (Speed) and the distances taken to stop (dist).

rock: Measurements on Petroleum Rock Samples. Area of pores space (area) and perimeter in pixels (peri)

pressure:Vapor Pressure of Mercury as a function of temparture

## Visualize linear regression
The end user can also choose the corresponded plot to visulaize the linear regression.

At the plot end user can choose data points, and then predictive line will be automatically generated from a linear model based on the chosen data points.

## App Link
The project is developed by Shiny App from Rstudio.
The Shiny App is accessible from here:https://cloe64.shinyapps.io/speed_vs_stop_distance/
